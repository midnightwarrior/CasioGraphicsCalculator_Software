# CasioGraphicsCalculator_Software
This is all of the software I've written for the Casio CFX-series graphics calculator.



Repository contents (will be updated when I add more code):

- Periodic table: this is a program I wrote back in 2011 which lets you browse the periodic table, in graphical form, on the Casio graphics calculator (tested on fx9750G Plus.)  Slow but usable, and uses up all but 1706 bytes (out of 28628 bytes) of memory.
